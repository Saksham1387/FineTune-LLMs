            "{'text': ['Speech disorders or speech impairments are a type of communication disorder in which normal speech is disrupted.[1] This can mean fluency disorders like stuttering, cluttering or lisps. Someone who is unable to speak due to a speech disorder is considered mute.[2] Speech skills are vital to social relationships and learning, and delays or disorders that relate to developing these skills can impact individuals function.[3] For many children and adolescents, this can present as issues with academics.[4] Speech disorders affect roughly 11.5% of the US population, and 5% of the primary school population.[5] Speech is a complex process that requires precise timing, nerve and muscle control, and as a result is susceptible to impairments. A person who has a stroke, an accident or birth defect may have speech and language problems.[6]\\n\\n\\nClassifying speech into normal and disordered is more problematic than it first seems. By strict classification,[citation needed] only 5% to 10% of the population has a completely normal manner of speaking (with respect to all parameters) and healthy voice; all others have one disorder or another.\\n\\n\\nThere are three different levels of classification when determining the magnitude and type of a speech disorder and the proper treatment or therapy:[7]\\n\\n\\nIn some cases the cause is unknown. However, there are various known causes of speech impairments, such as hearing loss, neurological disorders, brain injury, an increase in mental strain, constant bullying, intellectual disability, substance use disorder, physical impairments such as cleft lip and palate, and vocal abuse or misuse.[12] After strokes, there is known to be a higher incidence of apraxia of speech, which is a disorder affecting neurological pathways involved with speech.[13] Poor motor function is also suggested to be highly associated with speech disorders, especially in children.[14] Hereditary causes have also been suggested, as many times children of individuals with speech disorders will develop them as well.[15] 20-40% individuals with a family history of a specific language impairment are likely to be diagnosed, whereas only 4% of the population overall is likely to be diagnosed.[16] There are also language disorders that are known to be genetic, such as hereditary ataxia, which can cause slow and unclear speech.[17]\\n\\n\\nMany of these types of disorders can be treated by speech therapy, but others require medical attention by a doctor in phoniatrics. Other treatments include correction of organic conditions and psychotherapy.[18]\\n\\n\\nIn the United States, school-age children with a speech disorder are often placed in special education programs. Children who struggle to learn to talk often experience persistent communication difficulties in addition to academic struggles.[19] More than 700,000 of the students served in the public schools\\' special education programs in the 2000–2001 school year were categorized as having a speech or language impairment. This estimate does not include children who have speech and language impairments secondary to other conditions such as deafness\".[12] Many school districts provide the students with speech therapy during school hours, although extended day and summer services may be appropriate under certain circumstances.\\n\\n\\nPatients will be treated in teams, depending on the type of disorder they have.[clarification needed] A team can include speech–language pathologists, specialists, family doctors, teachers, and family members.\\n\\n\\nHaving a speech disorder can have negative social effects, especially among young children. Those with a speech disorder can be targets of bullying because of their disorder. This bullying can result in decreased self-esteem.[20] Religion and culture also play a large role in the social effects of speech disorders. For example, in many African countries like Kenya cleft palates are largely considered to be caused by a curse from God. This can cause people with cleft palates to not receive care in early childhood, and end in rejection from society.[6] For those with speech disorders, listeners reactions are often negative, which may correlate negative effects to self-esteem. It has also been shown that adults tend to view individuals with stutters in more negative ways than those without them.[21]\\n\\n\\nLanguage disorders are usually considered distinct from speech disorders, although they are often used synonymously.\\n\\n\\nSpeech disorders refer to problems in producing the sounds of speech or with the quality of voice, where language disorders are usually an impairment of either understanding words or being able to use words and do not have to do with speech production.[22]\\n', 'Vocal cord nodules are bilaterally symmetrical benign white masses that form at the midpoint of the vocal folds.[1] Although diagnosis involves a physical examination of the head and neck, as well as perceptual voice measures, visualization of the vocal nodules via laryngeal endoscopy remains the primary diagnostic method.[2][3] Vocal fold nodules interfere with the vibratory characteristics of the vocal folds by increasing the mass of the vocal folds and changing the configuration of the vocal fold closure pattern.[1][2][4] Due to these changes, the quality of the voice may be affected.[1] As such, the major perceptual signs of vocal fold nodules include vocal hoarseness and breathiness.[4][5] Other common symptoms include vocal fatigue, soreness or pain lateral to the larynx, and reduced frequency and intensity range.[1][4][5] Airflow levels during speech may also be increased.[1] Vocal fold nodules are thought to be the result of vocal fold tissue trauma caused by excessive mechanical stress, including repeated or chronic vocal overuse, abuse, or misuse.[1][2][5] Predisposing factors include profession, gender, dehydration, respiratory infection, and other inflammatory factors.[1][2]\\n\\n\\nFor professional voice users as well as individuals who frequently experience hoarseness, vocal hygiene practices are recommended for the prevention of vocal fold nodules and other voice disorders.[6] Vocal hygiene practices include three components: regulating the quantity and quality of voice use, improving vocal fold hydration, and reducing behaviours that jeopardize vocal health.[6] About 10% of nodules resolve on their own, which is more likely if they are smaller and the onset more recent.[7] Treatment of vocal fold nodules usually involves behavioural intervention therapy administered by a speech–language pathologist. In severe cases, surgery to remove the lesions is recommended for best prognosis.[8][9] In children, vocal fold nodules are more common in males; in adults, they are more common in females.[10][5]\\n\\n\\nOne of the major perceptual signs of vocal fold nodules is a change in the quality of the voice.[1] The voice may be perceived as hoarse,[4][5] due to aperiodic vibrations of the vocal folds,[5] and may also be perceived as breathy,[4][5] due to an incomplete closure of the vocal folds upon phonation.[1][4] The degree of hoarseness and breathiness perceived may vary in severity. This variability may be due to the size and firmness of the nodules.[4] Other common symptoms include difficulty producing vocal pitches in the higher range,[1][4][5] increased phonatory effort,[1] and vocal fatigue.[1][5] There may be a sensation of soreness or pain in the neck, lateral to the larynx,[1][4] which generally occurs because of the increased effort needed to produce the voice.[1]\\n\\n\\nMajor acoustic signs of vocal fold nodules involve changes in the frequency and the intensity of the voice. The fundamental frequency, an acoustic measure of voice pitch, may be normal. However, the range of pitches the individual is capable of producing may be reduced,[1][4] and it may be especially difficult to produce pitches in the higher range.[1][4][5] The intensity of the voice, an acoustic measure of amplitude or loudness, may also be normal.[1] However, the individual\\'s amplitude range may be reduced as well.[1][4] Perturbations or variations in frequency, known as jitter, and in amplitude, known as shimmer, may be increased.[4]\\n\\n\\nIf the nodules affect the closure of the vocal folds, airflow levels during speech may be increased in comparison to the speaker\\'s habitual levels. However, airflow levels may still fall within the upper limits of the normal range.[1] The degree to which an individual\\'s airflow levels increase seems to depend on the severity of the injury. Subglottal pressure, the air pressure that is available below the glottis and in the trachea to produce speech, may be increased as well.[4]\\n\\n\\nVocal fold nodules are thought to be the result of vocal fold tissue trauma caused by excessive mechanical stress.[1][2][5] During phonation, the vocal folds undergo many forms of mechanical stress. One example of such stress is the impact stress caused by the collision between the left and right vocal fold surfaces during vibration.[2] This stress is thought to reach its maximum in the mid-membranous region of the vocal folds, at the junction of the anterior 1/3rd and posterior 2/3rd, the most common site of nodule formation.[2][5] Vocal overuse (speaking for long periods), abuse (yelling), or misuse (hyperfunction) may produce excessive amounts of mechanical stress by increasing the rate and/or force with which the vocal folds collide. This may lead to trauma that is focalized to the mid-membranous vocal fold[5] and subsequent wound formation.[2] Repeated or chronic mechanical stress is thought to lead to the remodeling of the superficial layer of the lamina propria.[5] It is this process of tissue remodeling that results in the formation of benign lesions of the vocal folds such as nodules.[2][5]\\n\\n\\nThere are several factors that may predispose an individual to vocal fold nodules. Activities or professions that may contribute to phonotraumatic behaviors include cheerleading, untrained singing, speaking above noise, and teaching without voice amplification, as these increase mechanical stress and subsequent vocal fold trauma.[1] Gender may be another predisposing factor, as vocal fold nodules occur more frequently in females.[5] The presence of dehydration, respiratory infection, and inflammatory factors may also act as predisposing or aggravating factors. Inflammatory factors may include allergies, tobacco and alcohol use, laryngopharyngeal reflux, and other environmental influences.[1]\\n\\n\\nVocal fold nodules often alter the mechanical properties of the vocal folds, which can interfere with their vibratory characteristics.[1][4] Nodules may increase the mass of the vocal folds, especially along the medial edge where they are typically found. This increased mass may result in aperiodic or irregular vibration, the perception of greater pitch and loudness perturbations, and of increased hoarseness.[4] Nodules may also affect the mucosal wave of the vocal folds by changing the configuration of the vocal fold closure pattern. They often cause incomplete closure of the vocal folds, resulting in an hourglass configuration.[1][2][4] The incomplete closure allows more air to escape through the vocal folds, which often results in the perception of breathiness.[1][2] The degree to which nodules will affect the mucosal wave and vibratory characteristics of the vocal folds depends highly on the size of the nodule.[1][2] Smaller nodules may still allow the vocal folds to achieve complete closure.[1]\\n\\n\\nDiagnosing vocal fold nodules typically includes a comprehensive analysis of medical and voice history, a physical examination of the head and neck, perceptual evaluation of voice, and visualization of the vocal folds.[11] Visualization is considered to be the main method of diagnosis as perceptual evaluation, which includes acoustic and aerodynamic measures, alone is insufficient.[12] Laryngeal videostroboscopy, an imaging technique, is commonly used to view the vocal folds: this procedure can be performed nasally or orally.[11] Vocal fold nodules are most often characterized as bilaterally symmetrical whitish masses,[11] and tend to form at the midpoint of the vocal folds.[12]\\n\\n\\nNodules may prevent complete closure of the glottis, also known as glottal closure, and their presence may lead to an hourglass-shaped glottal closure.[11] Voice problems may result from the presence of vocal fold nodules.[13]  They are diagnosed based on the presence of perceptual features not explicable by other causes.[13] Such symptoms include: vocal fatigue, breathiness, loss of high pitch notes, lack of vocal control, or increased phonatory effort (i.e. increased effort to produce speech).[13]\\n\\n\\nFor individuals who work with their voice (e.g., singers, actors, teachers, stock brokers), voice training that includes vocal function exercises (VFEs) may help reduce undue vocal strain.[14] Furthermore, recommendations for voice professionals include warm-up and cool-down exercises for the voice to reduce strain.[14] Additionally, using amplification devices, such as speakers or microphones, is recommended for individuals who speak to large, and even small groups or in the presence of background noise.[6]\\n\\n\\nStaying hydrated decreases the pressure that the vocal folds exert on one another by ensuring sufficient lubrication by mucosa, increasing the efficiency of vocal fold oscillation during speech, and promoting a healthy voice quality.[15] Consumption of caffeine in large quantities is dehydrating and is therefore implicated in an increased risk of vocal fold nodules.[14]\\n\\n\\nBehaviours such as frequent throat clearing, shouting, speaking over background noise, and hard crying are associated with an increased risk of developing nodules and other vocal pathologies.[14] Furthermore, unconventional voice practices such as speaking in the falsetto register, cause excessive strain and may result in nodules.[16] The avoidance of damaging vocal behaviours may prevent the formation of nodules. Tobacco, alcohol, certain medications, and recreational drugs have also been implicated in pathologies of the vocal folds.[14] Reducing exposure to these substances has been shown to reduce one\\'s risk of nodules. Other behaviours that are implicated in vocal fold nodules include poor sleeping habits and poor nutrition.[14]\\n\\n\\nThe two main methods of treating vocal fold nodules are voice therapy (a behavioural treatment) and laryngeal microsurgery (a surgical treatment).[17] Because of general risks of surgery (e.g. scar formation, or those posed by general anesthesia[17]), behavioural treatment is usually recommended first.[17]\\n\\n\\nBehavioural voice therapy is typically carried out by speech–language pathologists.[18] While behavioural treatments methods vary greatly, they are generally effective at improving vocal quality and decreasing size of vocal fold nodules.[17][6] Complete resolution of nodules through behavioural treatment is possible[17] but unlikely.[6]\\n\\n\\nBehavioural techniques can be indirect or direct.[17] Indirect approaches focus on improving vocal hygiene, introducing and/or maintaining safe voice practices (thereby reducing opportunities for phonotrauma) and, occasionally, implementing vocal rest.[5] Direct approaches involve reducing the physiological strain on the vocal system while the voice is being used (e.g. during speaking or singing), such as by reducing collision forces between the vocal folds, ensuring sufficient pulmonary support while speaking (e.g. by changing the individual\\'s breathing pattern), and optimizing resonance of the larynx and other structures of the vocal apparatus.[6]\\n\\n\\nBehavioural treatments also vary in delivery model.[17] Traditional therapy distribution (e.g. eight sessions within eight weeks), more intensive approaches (e.g. eight session within three weeks) and remote therapy (i.e. telehealth) have all shown effectiveness in treating vocal fold nodules.[17]\\n\\n\\nAssessment of outcomes of behavioural treatments also varies greatly.[17] Effects can be measured visually[17] (e.g. by the same methods typically used to confirm the presence of vocal fold nodules: video endoscopy and video stroboscopy[17]), aerodynamically[17] (e.g. by measuring parameters such as transglottal pressure and the glottal airflow waveform[19]), perceptually[17] (e.g. by rating the voice in terms of dimensions such as roughness, breathiness, asthenia and strain[17]), in terms of effect on quality of life measures,[17] or using any combination of the above.[17]\\n\\n\\nFinally, recurrence of vocal fold nodules after behavioural treatment is always a possibility, particularly if nodules were not completely resolved or if skills gained during treatment were not carried-over outside of therapy sessions or maintained after therapy blocks.[17]\\n\\n\\nWhen behavioural treatments have been deemed ineffective for a voice user, surgical intervention is often considered.[17] Surgical treatments are considered in cases of unresolved dysphonia which negatively impacts the patient\\'s quality of life.[7] Removal of vocal fold nodules is a relatively safe and minor surgery[citation needed]. However, those who sing professionally or otherwise should take serious consideration before having surgery as it can affect the ability to sustain phonation, as well as alter the vocal range.[20] While the patient is subdued under general anesthesia, long thin scissors and scalpels or CO2 surgical lasers might be used to remove the nodules.[20]  Microsutures are sometimes used to close the incision.[20] Vocal rest for a period of 4 to 14 days is recommended post surgery to facilitate healing.[2]\\n\\n\\nVocal fold nodules typically respond well to non-surgical/behavioural treatment techniques such as those described in the \"Treatment\" section. Therefore, if the patient is able to engage in such behaviour modification techniques the prognosis is good (although exact data is not available).[1] If lesions are still present after non-surgical treatment methods, it is likely they are another form of  benign vocal fold lesion (polyp, fibrous mass, cyst, or pseudocyst). The prognosis of requiring surgery would only occur after an exhaustive attempt at non-surgical therapy techniques has been applied.[7]\\n\\n\\nResearch on the epidemiology of vocal fold nodules in children has suggested that nodules are more common in boys (2:1), in particular boys who are active and scream more frequently.[10][21] However, in adulthood, women are more likely to have nodules, and are especially likely if they have an outgoing personality or sing frequently.[14] The exact prevalence of vocal fold nodules is not known, but it has been reported that 23.4% of children who attended an ENT clinic for voice hoarseness, 6% of phoniatric clinic attendees, and 43% of teachers with dysphonia had nodules.[1]\\n', 'Spasmodic dysphonia, also known as laryngeal dystonia, is a disorder in which the muscles that generate a person\\'s voice go into periods of spasm.[1][2] This results in breaks or interruptions in the voice, often every few sentences, which can make a person difficult to understand.[1] The person\\'s voice may also sound strained or they may be nearly unable to speak.[2] Onset is often gradual and the condition is lifelong.[1]\\n\\n\\nThe cause is unknown.[1] Risk factors may include family history.[1] Triggers may include an upper respiratory infection, injury to the larynx, overuse of the voice, and psychological stress.[1] The underlying mechanism is believed to typically involve the central nervous system, specifically the basal ganglia.[1] Diagnosis is typically made following examination by a team of healthcare providers.[1]  It is a type of focal dystonia.[3]\\n\\n\\nWhile there is no cure, treatment may improve symptoms.[1] Most commonly this involves injecting botulinum toxin into the affected muscles of the larynx.[1] This generally results in improvement for a few months.[1] Other measures include voice therapy, counselling, and amplification devices.[1] If this is not effective, surgery may be considered; while evidence to support surgery is limited,[1] some have recovered following surgery.[4]\\n\\n\\nThe disorder affects an estimated 2 per 100,000 people.[1] Women are more commonly affected.[1] Onset is typically between the ages of 30 and 50.[1] Severity is variable between people.[2] In some, work and social life are affected.[2] Life expectancy is, however, normal.[5]\\n\\n\\nSymptoms of spasmodic dysphonia can come on suddenly or gradually appear over the span of years. They can come and go for hours or even weeks at a time, or remain consistent. Gradual onset can begin with the manifestation of a hoarse voice quality, which may later transform into a voice quality described as strained with breaks in phonation.[6] These phonation breaks have been compared to stuttering in the past, but there is a lack of research in support of spasmodic dysphonia being classified as a fluency disorder.[7] It is commonly reported by people with spasmodic dysphonia that symptoms almost only occur on vocal sounds that require phonation. Symptoms are less likely to occur at rest, while whispering, or on speech sounds that do not require phonation.[6] It is hypothesized this occurs because of an increase in sporadic, sudden, and prolonged tension found in the muscles around the larynx during phonation. This tension affects the abduction and adduction (opening and closing) of the vocal folds. Consequently, the vocal folds are unable to retain subglottal air pressure (required for phonation) and breaks in phonation can be heard throughout the speech of people with spasmodic dysphonia.[6]\\n\\n\\nRegarding types of spasmodic dysphonia, the main characteristic of spasmodic dysphonia, breaks in phonation, is found along with other varying symptoms.[6][7] The voice quality of adductor spasmodic dysphonia can be described as “strained-strangled” from tension in the glottal region.[7] Voice quality for abductor spasmodic dysphonia can be described as breathy from variable widening of the glottal region.[7] Vocal tremor may also be seen in spasmodic dysphonia.[7] A mix and variance of these symptoms are found in mixed spasmodic dysphonia.[7]\\n\\n\\nSymptoms of spasmodic dysphonia typically appear in middle aged people, but have also been seen in people in their twenties, with symptoms emerging as young as teenage years.[6]\\n\\n\\nAlthough the exact cause of spasmodic dysphonia is still unknown, epidemiological, genetic, and neurological pathogenic factors have been proposed in recent research.[8]\\n\\n\\nRisk factors include:[9]\\n\\n\\nIt has not been established whether these factors directly affect the development of spasmodic dysphonia (SD),[10] however these factors could be used to identify possible and/or at-risk patients.[8]\\n\\n\\nResearchers have also explored the possibility of a genetic component to SD. Three genes have been identified that may be related to the development of focal or segmental dystonia: TUBB4A, THAP1 and TOR1A genes.[8][11][12][13] However, a recent study that examined the mutation of these three genes in 86 SD patients found that only 2.3% of the patients had novel/rare variants in THAP1 but none in TUBB4A and TOR1A.[14] Evidence of a genetic contribution for dystonia involving the larynx is still weak and more research is needed in order to establish a causal relationship between SD and specific genes.[8]\\n\\n\\nSD is a neurological disorder rather than a disorder of the larynx, and as in other forms of dystonia, interventions at the end organ (i.e., larynx) have not offered a definitive cure, only symptomatic relief. The pathophysiology underlying dystonia is becoming better understood as a result of discoveries about genetically based forms of the disorder, and this approach is the most promising avenue to a long-term solution.[15]\\n\\n\\nSD is classified as a neurological disorder.[16] However, because the voice can sound normal or near normal at times, some practitioners believe it to be psychogenic; that is, originating in the affected person\\'s mind rather than from a physical cause.[17] This was especially true in the 19th and 20th centuries.[17] No medical organizations or groups take this position. A comparison of SD patients compared with vocal fold paralysis (VFP) patients found that 41.7% of the SD patients met the DSM-IV criteria for psychiatric comorbidity compared with 19.5% of the VFP group.[18] However, another study found the opposite, with SD patients having significantly less psychiatric comorbidity compared to VFP patients: \"The prevalence of major psychiatric cases varied considerably among the groups, from a low of seven percent (1/14) for spasmodic dysphonia, to 29.4 percent (5/17) for functional dysphonia, to a high of 63.6 percent (7/11) for vocal cord paralysis.\"[19] A review in the journal Swiss Medicine Weekly states that \"Psychogenic causes, a \\'psychological disequilibrium\\', and an increased tension of the laryngeal muscles are presumed to be one end of the spectrum of possible factors leading to the development of the disorder\".[20] Alternatively, many investigations into the condition feel that the psychiatric comorbidity associated with voice disorders is a result of the social isolation and anxiety that patients with these conditions feel as a consequence of their difficulty with speech, as opposed to the cause of their dysphonia.[21] The opinion that SD is psychogenic is not upheld by experts in the scientific community.[19][22]\\n\\n\\nSD is formally classified as a movement disorder; it is a type of focal dystonia known as laryngeal dystonia.[23]\\n\\n\\nDiagnosis of spasmodic dysphonia requires a multidisciplinary team and consideration of both perceptual and physiological factors.[24] There is currently no universally accepted diagnostic test for spasmodic dysphonia, which presents a challenge for diagnosis.[25] Additionally, diagnostic criteria have not been agreed upon as the distinguishing features of this disorder have not been well-characterized.[25][24]\\n\\n\\nA team of professionals including a speech-language pathologist, an otolaryngologist, and a neurologist, are typically involved in spasmodic dysphonia assessment and diagnosis.[26] The speech-language pathologist conducts a speech assessment including case history questions to gather information about voice use and symptoms.[24] This is followed by clinical observation and perceptual rating of voice characteristics such as voice breaks or strain, which are selectively present in normal speech over other voice activities such as whispering or laughing.[24] Symptoms also vary across types of spasmodic dysphonia.[25] For example, voiced sounds are more affected in adductor spasmodic dysphonia, while unvoiced sounds are more affected in abductor spasmodic dysphonia.[25] Following speech assessment, the otolaryngologist conducts a flexible transnasal laryngoscopy to view the vocal folds and activity of the muscles controlling them in order to eliminate other possible causes of the voice disorder.[24] In spasmodic dysphonia, producing long vowels or speaking sentences results in muscle spasms which are not observed during other vocal activities such as coughing, breathing, or whispering.[24] To evaluate the individual for any other neurological problems, this examination is followed up with an assessment by the neurologist.[26]\\n\\n\\nThe voice quality symbol for spasmodic dysphonia is ꟿ.[citation needed]\\n\\n\\nBecause spasmodic dysphonia shares many characteristics with other voice disorders, misdiagnosis frequently occurs. A common misdiagnosis is muscle tension dysphonia, a functional voice disorder which results from use of the voice, rather than a structural abnormality.[27][28] Some parameters can help guide the clinician towards a decision. In muscle tension dysphonia, the vocal folds are typically hyperadducted in constant way, not in a spasmodic way.[29] Additionally, the voice difficulties found in spasmodic dysphonia can be task specific, as opposed to those found in muscle tension dysphonia.[29] Being able to differentiate between muscle tension dysphonia and spasmodic dysphonia is important because muscle tension dysphonia typically responds well to behavioural voice treatment but spasmodic dysphonia does not.[29][27] This is crucial to avoid providing inappropriate treatment, but in some cases a trial of behavioural voice treatment can also be helpful to establish a differential diagnosis.[29]\\n\\n\\nSpasmodic dysphonia can also be misdiagnosed as voice tremor.[29] The movements that are found in this disorder are typically rhythmic in nature, as opposed to the muscle spasms of spasmodic dysphonia.[27] It is important to note that voice tremor and spasmodic dysphonia can co-occur in some patients.[27]\\n\\n\\nDifferential diagnosis is particularly important for determining appropriate interventions, as the type and cause of the disorder determine the most effective treatment.[27] Differences in treatment effectiveness are present even between the types of spasmodic dysphonia.[27] Diagnosis of spasmodic dysphonia is often delayed due to these challenges, which in turn presents difficulties in choosing the proper interventions.[27][28]\\n\\n\\nThe three types of spasmodic dysphonia (SD) are adductor spasmodic dysphonia, abductor spasmodic dysphonia, and mixed spasmodic dysphonia. A fourth type called whispering dysphonia has also been proposed.[30] Adductor spasmodic dysphonia is the most common type.[31]\\n\\n\\nAdductor spasmodic dysphonia (ADSD) is the most common type, affecting around 87% of individuals with SD.[17] In ADSD, sudden involuntary muscle movements or spasms cause the vocal folds (or vocal cords) to squeeze together and stiffen.[32] As the name suggests, these spasms occur in the adductor muscles of the vocal folds, specifically the thyroarytenoid and the lateral cricoarytenoid.[33] These spasms make it difficult for the vocal folds to vibrate and produce voice. Words are often cut off or are difficult to start because of the muscle spasms. Therefore, speech may be choppy but differs from stuttering. The voice of an individual with adductor spasmodic dysphonia is commonly described as strained or strangled and full of effort. Surprisingly, the spasms are usually absent while laughing, speaking at a high pitch, or speaking while singing, but singers can experience a loss of range or the inability to produce certain notes of a scale or with projection. Stress, however, often makes the muscle spasms more severe.[34]\\n\\n\\nAbductor spasmodic dysphonia (ABSD) is the second most common type, affecting around 13% of individuals with SD.[17] In ABSD, sudden involuntary muscle movements or spasms cause the vocal folds to open.[32] As the name suggests, these spasms occur in the single abductor muscle of the vocal folds, called the posterior cricoarytenoid. The vocal folds cannot vibrate when they are open. The open position of the vocal folds also allows air to escape from the lungs during speech. As a result, the voices of these individuals often sound weak, quiet, and breathy or whispery. As with adductor spasmodic dysphonia, the spasms are often absent during activities such as laughing or singing, but singers can experience a loss of range or the inability to produce certain notes of a scale or with projection.[34]\\n\\n\\nMixed spasmodic dysphonia is the most rare type. Mixed spasmodic dysphonia involves both muscles that open the vocal folds and those that close them and therefore has features of both adductor and abductor spasmodic dysphonia.[32] Some researchers believe that a subset of cases classified as mixed spasmodic dysphonia may actually be ADSD or ABSD subtype with the addition of compensatory voice behaviours that make it appear mixed.[17] This further adds to the difficulty in achieving accurate diagnosis.\\n\\n\\nA fourth type has also been described. This appears to be caused by mutations in the TUBB4 gene on the short arm of chromosome 19 (19p13.2-p13.3).[12] This gene encodes a tubulin gene. The pathophysiology of this condition has yet to be determined.\\n\\n\\nThere are a number of potential treatments for spasmodic dysphonia, including Botox, voice therapy, and surgery.[35] A number of medications have also been tried including anticholinergics (such as benztropine) which have been found to be effective in 40-50% of people, but which are associated with a number of side effects.[36]\\n\\n\\nBotulinum toxin (Botox) is often used to improve some symptoms of spasmodic dysphonia through weakening or paralyzing the vocal folds, thus preventing muscle spasms.[1][33] The level of evidence for its use is currently limited; little is known about optimal dosage, frequency of injections, or exact location of injection.[37][33][38] However, it remains a choice for many people due to the predictability and low chance of long term side effects. It results in periods of some improvement, with the duration of benefit lasting for 10–12 weeks on average before symptoms return to baseline. Repeat injection is required to sustain good vocal production, as results are only temporary.[35][33] Some transient side effects observed in adductor spasmodic dysphonia include reduced speaking volume, difficulty swallowing, and a breathy and hoarse voice quality.[39] While treatment outcomes are generally positive, it is presently unclear whether this treatment approach is more or less effective than others.[33]\\n\\n\\nVoice therapy appears to be ineffective in cases of true spasmodic dysphonia.[40] However, as it is difficult to distinguish between spasmodic dysphonia and functional dysphonias, and misdiagnosis is relatively common,[41] trial of voice therapy is often recommended before more invasive procedures are tried.[35] Some also state that it is useful for mild symptoms and as an add-on to botox therapy[42] and others report success in more severe cases.[43] Laryngeal manual therapy, which is massaging of the neck and cervical structures, also shows positive results for intervention of functional dysphonia.[44]\\n\\n\\nIf other measures are not effective, surgery may be considered; however, evidence to support surgery as a treatment for SD is limited.[1] Treatment outcomes are generally positive, though more research is required to determine its effectiveness.[33] Post-surgery voices can be imperfect and about 15% of people have significant difficulties.[40] If symptoms do recur, this typically happens in the first 12\\xa0months.[40] As of 2011, surgery was rarely used as a treatment approach for SD.[45] Surgical approaches include recurrent laryngeal nerve resection, selective laryngeal adductor denervation-reinnervation (SLAD-R), thyroplasty, thyroarytenoid myectomy, and laryngeal nerve crush.[33] Recurrent laryngeal nerve resection involves removing a section of the recurrent laryngeal nerve.[46] Recurrent laryngeal nerve avulsion is a more drastic removal of sections of the nerve,[46] and has positive outcomes of 80% at three years.[42] SLAD-R is effective specifically for adductor spasmodic dysphonia, for which it has shown good outcomes in about 80% of people at 8 years.[40] Thyroplasty changes the position or length of the vocal folds.\\n\\n\\nIn 1871, Ludwig Traube coined the term \\'Spastic Dysphonia\\' while writing a description of a patient who suffered from a nervous hoarseness.[47]\\n\\n\\nIn 1895, Johann Schnitzler used the term \"Spastic Aphonia\", which is now called abductor SD, and \"Phonic Laryngeal Spasms\", now called adductor SD. [48]\\n\\n\\nHermann Nothnagel followed by calling the condition \"Coordinated Laryngeal Spasms\", while Fraenkel coined the term \"Mogiphonia\" as a slowly developing disorder of the voice, in which is characterized by the increasing of vocal fatigue, the spasmodic constriction of the thorat muscles, and pain around the larynx. A comparison was made to \"mogigraphia\", which we now know as \"Writer\\'s Cramp\".\\n\\n\\nIn 1899, William Gowers described functional laryngeal spasms whereby the vocal cords were brought together with too much force while speaking. This was contrasted to Phonic Paralysis, where the speaker\\'s vocal chords could not be brought together during the action of speech. He reported in agreement with Fraenkel, that the vocal symptoms are most closely compared to Writers Cramp. Gowers reported and described a case by Gerhardt, where the patient had suffered from Writer\\'s Cramp, and had learned to play the flute at the age of 50. Blowing the flute caused laryngeal spasms and a voice sound unintended by the patient, accompanied by contractions of the arm and mouth. [49]\\n\\n\\nThis disorder was termed \"Spastic Dysphonia\", and as it was not a disorder with spasticity, was re-named to what is now called, \"Spasmodic Dysphonia\", by Arnold Aronson in 1968.[50]\\n\\n\\nIn earlier works, Aronson performed Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory screening and helped to establish SD as not being a Psychiatric Disorder, after reviewing psychiatric interviews of SD patients. Aronson formally characterized the 2 types of SD, the adductor, and abductor forms. Aronson described that adductor SD suffered from decreased loudness, and a mono-tonality, with a choked, strain-strangled voice quality. A vocal tremor was also often heard with a slowed speech rate. this was compared to what is seen in Essential Tremor.[50][51]\\n\\n\\nInitial surgical efforts to treat the condition were published in 1976 by Herbert Dedo and involved cutting of the recurrent laryngeal nerve.[35][52]\\n', 'In aphasia (sometimes called dysphasia),[a] a person may be unable to comprehend or unable to formulate language because of damage to specific brain regions.[2] The major causes are stroke and head trauma; prevalence is hard to determine but aphasia due to stroke is estimated to be 0.1–0.4% in the Global North.[3] Aphasia can also be the result of brain tumors, epilepsy, autoimmune neurological diseases,[4] brain infections,[5] or neurodegenerative diseases (such as dementias).[6][7]\\n\\n\\nTo be diagnosed with aphasia, a person\\'s language must be significantly impaired in one (or more) of the four aspects of communication. Alternatively, in the case of progressive aphasia, it must have significantly declined over a short period of time. The four aspects of communication are spoken language production and comprehension and written language production and comprehension; impairments in any of these aspects can impact on functional communication.\\n\\n\\nThe difficulties of people with aphasia can range from occasional trouble finding words, to losing the ability to speak, read, or write; intelligence, however, is unaffected.[7] Expressive language and receptive language can both be affected as well. Aphasia also affects visual language such as sign language.[2] In contrast, the use of formulaic expressions in everyday communication is often preserved.[8] For example, while a person with aphasia, particularly expressive aphasia (Broca\\'s aphasia), may not be able to ask a loved one when their birthday is, they may still be able to sing \"Happy Birthday\". One prevalent deficit in all aphasias is anomia, which is a difficulty in finding the correct word.[9]:\\u200a72\\u200a\\n\\n\\nWith aphasia, one or more modes of communication in the brain have been damaged and are therefore functioning incorrectly. Aphasia is not caused by damage to the brain that results in motor or sensory deficits, which produces abnormal speech; that is, aphasia is not related to the mechanics of speech but rather the individual\\'s language cognition (although a person can have both problems, as an example, if they have a haemorrhage that damaged a large area of the brain). An individual\\'s language is the socially shared set of rules, as well as the thought processes that go behind communication (as it affects both verbal and nonverbal language). It is not a result of a more peripheral motor or sensory difficulty, such as paralysis affecting the speech muscles or a general hearing impairment.\\n\\n\\nNeurodevelopmental forms of auditory processing disorder are differentiable from aphasia in that aphasia is by definition caused by acquired brain injury, but acquired epileptic aphasia has been viewed as a form of APD.\\n\\n\\nPeople with aphasia may experience any of the following behaviors due to an acquired brain injury, although some of these symptoms may be due to related or concomitant problems, such as dysarthria or apraxia, and not primarily due to aphasia. Aphasia symptoms can vary based on the location of damage in the brain. Signs and symptoms may or may not be present in individuals with aphasia and may vary in severity and level of disruption to communication.[10] Often those with aphasia may have a difficulty with naming objects, so they might use words such as thing or point at the objects. When asked to name a pencil they may say it is a \"thing used to write\".[11]\\n\\n\\nGiven the previously stated signs and symptoms, the following behaviors are often seen in people with aphasia as a result of attempted compensation for incurred speech and language deficits:\\n\\n\\nWhile aphasia has traditionally been described in terms of language deficits, there is increasing evidence that many people with aphasia commonly experience co-occurring non-linguistic cognitive deficits in areas such as attention, memory, executive functions and learning.[13][14][15] By some accounts, cognitive deficits, such as attention and working memory constitute the underlying cause of language impairment in people with aphasia.[16] Others suggest that cognitive deficits often co-occur but are comparable to cognitive deficits in stroke patients without aphasia and reflect general brain dysfunction following injury.[17] Whilst it has been shown that cognitive neural networks support language reorganisation after stroke,[18]\\nThe degree to which deficits in attention and other cognitive domains underlie language deficits in aphasia is still unclear.[19]\\n\\n\\nIn particular, people with aphasia often demonstrate short-term and working memory deficits.[15] These deficits can occur in both the verbal domain[20][21] as well as the visuospatial domain.[22] Furthermore, these deficits are often associated with performance on language specific tasks such as naming, lexical processing, and sentence comprehension, and discourse production.[23][15][24][25] Other studies have found that most, but not all people with aphasia demonstrate performance deficits on tasks of attention, and their performance on these tasks correlate with language performance and cognitive ability in other domains.[15] Even patients with mild aphasia, who score near the ceiling on tests of language often demonstrate slower response times and interference effects in non-verbal attention abilities.[26]\\n\\n\\nIn addition to deficits in short-term memory, working memory, and attention, people with aphasia can also demonstrate deficits in executive function.[27] For instance, people with aphasia may demonstrate deficits in initiation, planning, self-monitoring, and cognitive flexibility.[28] Other studies have found that people with aphasia demonstrate reduced speed and efficiency during completion executive function assessments.[29]\\n\\n\\nRegardless of their role in the underlying nature of aphasia, cognitive deficits have a clear role in the study and rehabilitation of aphasia. For instance, the severity of cognitive deficits in people with aphasia has been associated with lower quality of life, even more so than the severity of language deficits.[30] Furthermore, cognitive deficits may influence the learning process of rehabilitation[31][32] and language treatment outcomes in aphasia.[33][34] Non-linguistic cognitive deficits have also been the target of interventions directed at improving language ability, though outcomes are not definitive.[35] While some studies have demonstrated language improvement secondary to cognitively-focused treatment,[36] others have found little evidence that the treatment of cognitive deficits in people with aphasia has an influence on language outcomes.[37]\\n\\n\\nOne important caveat in the measurement and treatment of cognitive deficits in people with aphasia is the degree to which assessments of cognition rely on language abilities for successful performance.[38] Most studies have attempted to circumvent this challenge by utilizing non-verbal cognitive assessments to evaluate cognitive ability in people with aphasia. However, the degree to which these tasks are truly \\'non-verbal\\' and not mediated by language in unclear.[19] For instance, Wall et al.[23] found that language and non-linguistic performance was related, except when non-linguistic performance was measured by \\'real life\\' cognitive tasks.\\n\\n\\nAphasia is most often caused by stroke, where about a quarter of patients who experience an acute stroke develop aphasia.[39] However, any disease or damage to the parts of the brain that control language can cause aphasia. Some of these can include brain tumors, traumatic brain injury, epilepsy and progressive neurological disorders.[40] In rare cases, aphasia may also result from herpesviral encephalitis.[41] The herpes simplex virus affects the frontal and temporal lobes, subcortical structures, and the hippocampal tissue, which can trigger aphasia.[42] In acute disorders, such as head injury or stroke, aphasia usually develops quickly. When caused by brain tumor, infection, or dementia, it develops more slowly.[7][43]\\n\\n\\nSubstantial damage to tissue anywhere within the region shown in blue (on the figure in the infobox above) can potentially result in aphasia.[1] Aphasia can also sometimes be caused by damage to subcortical structures deep within the left hemisphere, including the thalamus, the internal and external capsules, and the caudate nucleus of the basal ganglia.[44][45] The area and extent of brain damage or atrophy will determine the type of aphasia and its symptoms.[7][43] A very small number of people can experience aphasia after damage to the right hemisphere only. It has been suggested that these individuals may have had an unusual brain organization prior to their illness or injury, with perhaps greater overall reliance on the right hemisphere for language skills than in the general population.[46][47]\\n\\n\\nPrimary progressive aphasia (PPA), while its name can be misleading, is actually a form of dementia that has some symptoms closely related to several forms of aphasia. It is characterized by a gradual loss in language functioning while other cognitive domains are mostly preserved, such as memory and personality. PPA usually initiates with sudden word-finding difficulties in an individual and progresses to a reduced ability to formulate grammatically correct sentences (syntax) and impaired comprehension. The etiology of PPA is not due to a stroke, traumatic brain injury (TBI), or infectious disease; it is still uncertain what initiates the onset of PPA in those affected by it.[48]\\n\\n\\nEpilepsy can also include transient aphasia as a prodromal or episodic symptom.[49] However, the repeated seizure activity within language regions may also lead to chronic, and progressive aphasia.  Aphasia is also listed as a rare side-effect of the fentanyl patch, an opioid used to control chronic pain.[50]\\n\\n\\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are the most common neuroimaging tools used in identifying aphasia and studying the extent of damage in the loss of language abilities. This is done by doing MRI scans and locating the extent of lesions or damage within brain tissue, particularly within areas of the left frontal and temporal regions- where a lot of language related areas lie. In fMRI studies a language related task is often completed and then the BOLD image is analyzed. If there are lower than normal BOLD responses that indicate a lessening of blood flow to the affected area and can show quantitatively that the cognitive task is not being completed.\\n\\n\\nThere are limitations to the use of fMRI in aphasic patients particularly. Because a high percentage of aphasic patients develop it because of stroke there can be infarct present which is the total loss of blood flow. This can be due to the thinning of blood vessels or the complete blockage of it. This is important in fMRI as it relies on the BOLD response (the oxygen levels of the blood vessels), and this can create a false hyporesponse upon fMRI study.[51] Due to the limitations of fMRI such as a lower spatial resolution, it can show that some areas of the brain are not active during a task when they in reality are. Additionally, with stroke being the cause of many cases of aphasia the extent of damage to brain tissue can be difficult to quantify therefore the effects of stroke brain damage on the functionality of the patient can vary.\\n\\n\\nNeural substrates of aphasia subtypes\\n\\n\\nMRI is often used to predict or confirm the subtype of aphasia present. Researchers compared 3 subtypes of aphasia- nonfluent-variant primary progressive aphasia (nfPPA), logopenic-variant primary progressive aphasia (lvPPA), and semantic-variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA), with primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and Alzheimer\\'s disease. This was done by analyzing the MRIs of patients with each of the subsets of PPA.[52] Images which compare subtypes of aphasia as well as for finding the extent of lesions are generated by overlapping images of different participant\\'s brains (if applicable) and isolating areas of lesions or damage using third-party software such as MRIcron. MRI has also been used to study the relationship between the type of aphasia developed and the age of the person with aphasia. It was found that patients with fluent aphasia are on average older than people with non-fluent aphasia. It was also found that among patients with lesions confined to the anterior portion of the brain an unexpected portion of them presented with fluent aphasia and were remarkably older than those with non-fluent aphasia. This effect was not found when the posterior portion of the brain was studied.[53]\\n\\n\\nAssociated conditions\\n\\n\\nIn a study on the features associated with different disease trajectories in Alzheimer\\'s disease (AD)-related primary progressive aphasia (PPA), it was found that metabolic patterns via PET SPM analysis can help predict progression of total loss of speech and functional autonomy in AD and PPA patients. This was done by comparing an MRI or CT image of the brain and presence of a radioactive biomarker with normal levels in patients without Alzheimer\\'s Disease.[54] Apraxia is another disorder often correlated with aphasia. This is due to a subset of apraxia which affects speech. Specifically, this subset affects the movement of muscles associated with speech production, apraxia and aphasia are often correlated due to the proximity of neural substrates associated with each of the disorders.[55] Researchers concluded that there were 2 areas of lesion overlap between patients with apraxia and aphasia, the anterior temporal lobe and the left inferior parietal lobe.[56]\\n\\n\\nTreatment and neuroimaging\\n\\n\\nEvidence for positive treatment outcomes can also be quantified using neuroimaging tools. The use of fMRI and an automatic classifier can help predict language recovery outcomes in stroke patients with 86% accuracy when coupled with age and language test scores. The stimuli tested were sentences both correct and incorrect and the subject had to press a button whenever the sentence was incorrect. The fMRI data collected focused on responses in regions of interest identified by healthy subjects.[57] \\xa0Recovery from aphasia can also be quantified using diffusion tensor imaging. The accurate fasciculus (AF) connects the right and left superior temporal lobe, premotor regions/posterior inferior frontal gyrus. and the primary motor cortex. In a study which enrolled patients in a speech therapy program, an increase in AF fibers and volume was found in patients after 6-weeks in the program which correlated with long-term improvement in those patients.[58] The results of the experiment are pictured in Figure 2. This implies that DTI can be used to quantify the improvement in patients after speech and language treatment programs are applied.\\n\\n\\nAphasia is best thought of as a collection of different disorders, rather than a single problem. Each individual with aphasia will present with their own particular combination of language strengths and weaknesses. Consequently, it is a major challenge just to document the various difficulties that can occur in different people, let alone decide how they might best be treated. Most classifications of the aphasias tend to divide the various symptoms into broad classes. A common approach is to distinguish between the fluent aphasias (where speech remains fluent, but content may be lacking, and the person may have difficulties understanding others), and the nonfluent aphasias (where speech is very halting and effortful, and may consist of just one or two words at a time).[59]\\n\\n\\nHowever, no such broad-based grouping has proven fully adequate, or reliable. There is wide variation among people even within the same broad grouping, and aphasias can be highly selective. For instance, people with naming deficits (anomic aphasia) might show an inability only for naming buildings, or people, or colors.[60] Unfortunately, assessments that characterize aphasia in these groupings have persisted. This is not helpful to people living with aphasia, and provides inaccurate descriptions of an individual pattern of difficulties.\\n\\n\\nIt is important to note that there are typical difficulties with speech and language that come with normal aging as well. As we age, language can become more difficult to process resulting in a slowing of verbal comprehension, reading abilities and more likely word finding difficulties. With each of these though, unlike some aphasias, functionality within daily life remains intact.[9]:\\u200a7\\u200a\\n\\n\\nLocalizationist approaches aim to classify the aphasias according to their major presenting characteristics and the regions of the brain that most probably gave rise to them.[75][76] Inspired by the early work of nineteenth-century neurologists Paul Broca and Carl Wernicke, these approaches identify two major subtypes of aphasia and several more minor subtypes:\\n\\n\\nRecent classification schemes adopting this approach, such as the Boston-Neoclassical Model,[75] also group these classical aphasia subtypes into two larger classes: the nonfluent aphasias (which encompasses Broca\\'s aphasia and transcortical motor aphasia) and the fluent aphasias (which encompasses Wernicke\\'s aphasia, conduction aphasia and transcortical sensory aphasia). These schemes also identify several further aphasia subtypes, including: anomic aphasia, which is characterized by a selective difficulty finding the names for things; and global aphasia, where both expression and comprehension of speech are severely compromised.\\n\\n\\nMany localizationist approaches also recognize the existence of additional, more \"pure\" forms of language disorder that may affect only a single language skill.[78] For example, in pure alexia, a person may be able to write but not read, and in pure word deafness, they may be able to produce speech and to read, but not understand speech when it is spoken to them.\\n\\n\\nAlthough localizationist approaches provide a useful way of classifying the different patterns of language difficulty into broad groups, one problem is that most individuals do not fit neatly into one category or another.[79][80] Another problem is that the categories, particularly the major ones such as Broca\\'s and Wernicke\\'s aphasia, still remain quite broad and do not meaningfully reflect a person\\'s difficulties. Consequently, even amongst those who meet the criteria for classification into a subtype, there can be enormous variability in the types of difficulties they experience.[81]\\n\\n\\nInstead of categorizing every individual into a specific subtype, cognitive neuropsychological approaches aim to identify the key language skills or \"modules\" that are not functioning properly in each individual. A person could potentially have difficulty with just one module, or with a number of modules. This type of approach requires a framework or theory as to what skills/modules are needed to perform different kinds of language tasks. For example, the model of Max Coltheart identifies a module that recognizes phonemes as they are spoken, which is essential for any task involving recognition of words. Similarly, there is a module that stores phonemes that the person is planning to produce in speech, and this module is critical for any task involving the production of long words or long strings of speech. Once a theoretical framework has been established, the functioning of each module can then be assessed using a specific test or set of tests. In the clinical setting, use of this model usually involves conducting a battery of assessments,[82][83] each of which tests one or a number of these modules. Once a diagnosis is reached as to the skills/modules where the most significant impairment lies, therapy can proceed to treat these skills.\\n\\n\\nPrimary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a neurodegenerative focal dementia that can be associated with progressive illnesses or dementia, such as frontotemporal dementia / Pick Complex Motor neuron disease, Progressive supranuclear palsy, and Alzheimer\\'s disease, which is the gradual process of progressively losing the ability to think. Gradual loss of language function occurs in the context of relatively well-preserved memory, visual processing, and personality until the advanced stages. Symptoms usually begin with word-finding problems (naming) and progress to impaired grammar (syntax) and comprehension (sentence processing and semantics). The loss of language before the loss of memory differentiates PPA from typical dementias. People with PPA may have difficulties comprehending what others are saying. They can also have difficulty trying to find the right words to make a sentence.[84][85][86] There are three classifications of Primary Progressive Aphasia\\xa0: Progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA), Semantic Dementia (SD), and Logopenic progressive aphasia (LPA).[86][87]\\n\\n\\nProgressive Jargon Aphasia[citation needed] is a fluent or receptive aphasia in which the person\\'s speech is incomprehensible, but appears to make sense to them. Speech is fluent and effortless with intact syntax and grammar, but the person has problems with the selection of nouns. Either they will replace the desired word with another that sounds or looks like the original one or has some other connection or they will replace it with sounds. As such, people with jargon aphasia often use neologisms, and may perseverate if they try to replace the words they cannot find with sounds. Substitutions commonly involve picking another (actual) word starting with the same sound (e.g., clocktower – colander), picking another semantically related to the first (e.g., letter – scroll), or picking one phonetically similar to the intended one (e.g., lane – late).\\n\\n\\nThere have been many instances showing that there is a form of aphasia among deaf individuals. Sign languages are, after all, forms of language that have been shown to use the same areas of the brain as verbal forms of language. Mirror neurons become activated when an animal is acting in a particular way or watching another individual act in the same manner. These mirror neurons are important in giving an individual the ability to mimic movements of hands. Broca\\'s area of speech production has been shown to contain several of these mirror neurons resulting in significant similarities of brain activity between sign language and vocal speech communication. People use facial movements to create, what other people perceive, to be faces of emotions. While combining these facial movements with speech, a more full form of language is created which enables the species to interact with a much more complex and detailed form of communication. Sign language also uses these facial movements and emotions along with the primary hand movement way of communicating. These facial movement forms of communication come from the same areas of the brain. When dealing with damages to certain areas of the brain, vocal forms of communication are in jeopardy of severe forms of aphasia. Since these same areas of the brain are being used for sign language, these same, at least very similar, forms of aphasia can show in the Deaf community. Individuals can show a form of Wernicke\\'s aphasia with sign language and they show deficits in their abilities in being able to produce any form of expressions. Broca\\'s aphasia shows up in some people, as well. These individuals find tremendous difficulty in being able to actually sign the linguistic concepts they are trying to express.[88]\\n\\n\\nThe severity of the type of aphasia varies depending on the size of the stroke. However, there is much variance between how often one type of severity occurs in certain types of aphasia. For instance, any type of aphasia can range from mild to profound. Regardless of the severity of aphasia, people can make improvements due to spontaneous recovery and treatment in the acute stages of recovery.[89] Additionally, while most studies propose that the greatest outcomes occur in people with severe aphasia when treatment is provided in the acute stages of recovery, Robey (1998) also found that those with severe aphasia are capable of making strong language gains in the chronic stage of recovery as well.[89] This finding implies that persons with aphasia have the potential to have functional outcomes regardless of how severe their aphasia may be.[89] While there is no distinct pattern of the outcomes of aphasia based on severity alone, global aphasia typically makes functional language gains, but may be gradual since global aphasia affects many language areas.[citation needed]\\n\\n\\nAphasia is largely caused by unavoidable instances. However, some precautions can be taken to decrease risk for experiencing one of the two major causes of aphasia: stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI). To decrease the probability of having an ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, one should take the following precautions:\\n\\n\\nTo prevent aphasia due to traumatic injury, one should take precautionary measures when engaging in dangerous activities such as:\\n\\n\\nAdditionally, one should always seek medical attention after sustaining head trauma due to a fall or accident. The sooner that one receives medical attention for a traumatic brain injury, the less likely one is to experience long-term or severe effects.[93]\\n\\n\\nMost acute cases of aphasia recover some or most skills by participating in speech and language therapy. Recovery and improvement can continue for years after the stroke. After the onset of aphasia, there is approximately a six-month period of spontaneous recovery; during this time, the brain is attempting to recover and repair the damaged neurons. Improvement varies widely, depending on the aphasia\\'s cause, type, and severity. Recovery also depends on the person\\'s age, health, motivation, handedness, and educational level.[43]\\n\\n\\nSpeech and language therapy that is higher intensity, higher dose or provided over a long duration of time leads to significantly better functional communication but people might be more likely to drop out of high intensity treatment (up to 15 hours per week).[94] A total of 20–50 hours of speech and language therapy is necessary for the best recovery. The most improvement happens when 2–5 hours of therapy is provided each week over 4–5 days. Recovery is further improved when besides the therapy people practice tasks at home.[95][96] Speech and language therapy is also effective if it is delivered online through video or by a family member who has been trained by a professional therapist.[95][96]\\n\\n\\nRecovery with therapy is also dependent on the recency of stroke and the age of the person. Receiving therapy within a month after the stroke leads to the greatest improvements. 3 or 6 months after the stroke more therapy will be needed but symptoms can still be improved. People with aphasia who are younger than 55 years are the most likely to improve but people older than 75 years can still get better with therapy.[95][96]\\n\\n\\nThere is no one treatment proven to be effective for all types of aphasias. The reason that there is no universal treatment for aphasia is because of the nature of the disorder and the various ways it is presented. Aphasia is rarely exhibited identically, implying that treatment needs to be catered specifically to the individual. Studies have shown that, although there is no consistency on treatment methodology in literature, there is a strong indication that treatment, in general, has positive outcomes.[97] Therapy for aphasia ranges from increasing functional communication to improving speech accuracy, depending on the person\\'s severity, needs and support of family and friends.[98] Group therapy allows individuals to work on their pragmatic and communication skills with other individuals with aphasia, which are skills that may not often be addressed in individual one-on-one therapy sessions. It can also help increase confidence and social skills in a comfortable setting.[9]:\\u200a97\\u200a\\n\\n\\nEvidence does not support the use of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) for improving aphasia after stroke. Moderate quality evidence does indicate naming performance improvements for nouns but not verbs using tDCS[99]\\n\\n\\nSpecific treatment techniques include the following:\\n\\n\\nSemantic feature analysis (SFA) – a type of aphasia treatment that targets word-finding deficits. It is based on the theory that neural connections can be strengthened by using related words and phrases that are similar to the target word, to eventually activate the target word in the brain. SFA can be implemented in multiple forms such as verbally, written, using picture cards, etc. The SLP provides prompting questions to the individual with aphasia in order for the person to name the picture provided.[104] Studies show that SFA is an effective intervention for improving confrontational naming.[105]\\n\\n\\nMelodic intonation therapy is used to treat non-fluent aphasia and has proved to be effective in some cases.[106] However, there is still no evidence from randomized controlled trials confirming the efficacy of MIT in chronic aphasia. MIT is used to help people with aphasia vocalize themselves through speech song, which is then transferred as a spoken word. Good candidates for this therapy include people who have had left hemisphere strokes, non-fluent aphasias such as Broca\\'s, good auditory comprehension, poor repetition and articulation, and good emotional stability and memory.[107] An alternative explanation is that the efficacy of MIT depends on neural circuits involved in the processing of rhythmicity and formulaic expressions (examples taken from the MIT manual: \"I am fine,\" \"how are you?\" or \"thank you\"); while rhythmic features associated with melodic intonation may engage primarily left-hemisphere subcortical areas of the brain, the use of formulaic expressions is known to be supported by right-hemisphere cortical and bilateral subcortical neural networks.[8][108]\\n\\n\\nSystematic reviews support the effectiveness and importance of partner training.[109] According to the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD), involving family with the treatment of an aphasic loved one is ideal for all involved, because while it will no doubt assist in their recovery, it will also make it easier for members of the family to learn how best to communicate with them.[110]\\n\\n\\nWhen a person\\'s speech is insufficient, different kinds of augmentative and alternative communication could be considered such as alphabet boards, pictorial communication books, specialized software for computers or apps for tablets or smartphones.[111]\\n\\n\\nWhen addressing Wernicke\\'s aphasia, according to Bakheit et al. (2007), the lack of awareness of the language impairments, a common characteristic of Wernicke\\'s aphasia, may affect the rate and extent of therapy outcomes.[112] Robey (1998) determined that at least 2 hours of treatment per week is recommended for making significant language gains.[89] Spontaneous recovery may cause some language gains, but without speech-language therapy, the outcomes can be half as strong as those with therapy.[89]\\n\\n\\nWhen addressing Broca\\'s aphasia, better outcomes occur when the person participates in therapy, and treatment is more effective than no treatment for people in the acute period.[89] Two or more hours of therapy per week in acute and post-acute stages produced the greatest results.[89] High-intensity therapy was most effective, and low-intensity therapy was almost equivalent to no therapy.[89]\\n\\n\\nPeople with global aphasia are sometimes referred to as having irreversible aphasic syndrome, often making limited gains in auditory comprehension, and recovering no functional language modality with therapy. With this said, people with global aphasia may retain gestural communication skills that may enable success when communicating with conversational partners within familiar conditions. Process-oriented treatment options are limited, and people may not become competent language users as readers, listeners, writers, or speakers no matter how extensive therapy is.[66] However, people\\'s daily routines and quality of life can be enhanced with reasonable and modest goals.[66] After the first month, there is limited to no healing to language abilities of most people. There is a grim prognosis leaving 83% who were globally aphasic after the first month they will remain globally aphasic at the first year. Some people are so severely impaired that their existing process-oriented treatment approaches offer no signs of progress, and therefore cannot justify the cost of therapy.[66]\\n\\n\\nPerhaps due to the relative rareness of conduction aphasia, few studies have specifically studied the effectiveness of therapy for people with this type of aphasia. From the studies performed, results showed that therapy can help to improve specific language outcomes. One intervention that has had positive results is auditory repetition training. Kohn et al. (1990) reported that drilled auditory repetition training related to improvements in spontaneous speech, Francis et al. (2003) reported improvements in sentence comprehension, and Kalinyak-Fliszar et al. (2011) reported improvements in auditory-visual short-term memory.[113][114][115]\\n\\n\\nIntensity of treatment should be individualized based on the recency of stroke, therapy goals, and other specific characteristics such as age, size of lesion, overall health status, and motivation.[116][117] Each individual reacts differently to treatment intensity and is able to tolerate treatment at different times post-stroke.[117] Intensity of treatment after a stroke should be dependent on the person\\'s motivation, stamina, and tolerance for therapy.[118]\\n\\n\\nIf the symptoms of aphasia last longer than two or three months after a stroke, a complete recovery is unlikely. However, it is important to note that some people continue to improve over a period of years and even decades. Improvement is a slow process that usually involves both helping the individual and family understand the nature of aphasia and learning compensatory strategies for communicating.[119]\\n\\n\\nAfter a traumatic brain injury (TBI) or cerebrovascular accident (CVA), the brain undergoes several healing and re-organization processes, which may result in improved language function. This is referred to as spontaneous recovery. Spontaneous recovery is the natural recovery the brain makes without treatment, and the brain begins to reorganize and change in order to recover.[66] There are several factors that contribute to a person\\'s chance of recovery caused by stroke, including stroke size and location.[120] Age, sex, and education have not been found to be very predictive.[120] There is also research pointing to damage in the left hemisphere healing more effectively than the right.[39]\\n\\n\\nSpecific to aphasia, spontaneous recovery varies among affected people and may not look the same in everyone, making it difficult to predict recovery.[120]\\n\\n\\nThough some cases of Wernicke\\'s aphasia have shown greater improvements than more mild forms of aphasia, people with Wernicke\\'s aphasia may not reach as high a level of speech abilities as those with mild forms of aphasia.[121]\\n\\n\\nAphasia affects about two million people in the U.S. and 250,000 people in Great Britain.[122] Nearly 180,000 people acquire the disorder every year in the U.S.,[123] 170,000 due to stroke.[124] Any person of any age can develop aphasia, given that it is often caused by a traumatic injury. However, people who are middle aged and older are the most likely to acquire aphasia, as the other etiologies are more likely at older ages.[125] For example, approximately 75% of all strokes occur in individuals over the age of 65.[126] Strokes account for most documented cases of aphasia:[127] 25% to 40% of people who survive a stroke develop aphasia as a result of damage to the language-processing regions of the brain.[6]\\n\\n\\nThe first recorded case of aphasia is from an Egyptian papyrus, the Edwin Smith Papyrus, which details speech problems in a person with a traumatic brain injury to the temporal lobe.[128]\\n\\n\\nDuring the second half of the 19th century, aphasia was a major focus for scientists and philosophers who were working in the beginning stages of the field of psychology.[2]\\nIn medical research, speechlessness was described as an incorrect prognosis, and there was no assumption that underlying language complications existed.[129] Broca and his colleagues were some of the first to write about aphasia, but Wernicke was the first credited to have written extensively about aphasia being a disorder that contained comprehension difficulties.[130] Despite claims of who reported on aphasia first, it was F.J. Gall that gave the first full description of aphasia after studying wounds to the brain, as well as his observation of speech difficulties resulting from vascular lesions.[131] A recent book on the entire history of aphasia is available (Reference: Tesak, J. & Code, C. (2008) Milestones in the History of Aphasia: Theories and Protagonists. Hove, East Sussex: Psychology Press).\\n\\n\\nAphasia is from Greek a- (\"without\", negative prefix) + phásis (φάσις, \"speech\").\\n\\n\\nThe word aphasia comes from the word ἀφασία aphasia, in Ancient Greek, which means[90] \"speechlessness\",[132] derived from ἄφατος aphatos, \"speechless\"[133] from ἀ- a-, \"not, un\" and φημί phemi, \"I speak\".\\n\\n\\nResearch is currently being done using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to witness the difference in how language is processed in normal brains vs aphasic brains. This will help researchers to understand exactly what the brain must go through in order to recover from Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and how different areas of the brain respond after such an injury.[134]\\n\\n\\nAnother intriguing approach being tested is that of drug therapy. Research is in progress that will hopefully uncover whether or not certain drugs might be used in addition to speech-language therapy in order to facilitate recovery of proper language function. It\\'s possible that the best treatment for Aphasia might involve combining drug treatment with therapy, instead of relying on one over the other.[135]\\n\\n\\nOne other method being researched as a potential therapeutic combination with speech-language therapy is brain stimulation. One particular method, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), alters brain activity in whatever area it happens to stimulate, which has recently led scientists to wonder if this shift in brain function caused by TMS might help people re-learn languages.\\n\\n\\nThe research being put into Aphasia has only just begun. Researchers appear to have multiple ideas on how Aphasia could be more effectively treated in the future.[110]\\n', '\\n\\n\\nPuberty is the process of physical changes through which a child\\'s body matures into an adult body capable of sexual reproduction. It is initiated by hormonal signals from the brain to the gonads: the ovaries in a female, the testicles in a male. In response to the signals, the gonads produce hormones that stimulate libido and the growth, function, and transformation of the brain, bones, muscle, blood, skin, hair, breasts, and sex organs. Physical growth—height and weight—accelerates in the first half of puberty and is completed when an adult body has been developed. Before puberty, the external sex organs, known as primary sexual characteristics, are sex characteristics that distinguish males and females. Puberty leads to sexual dimorphism through the development of the secondary sex characteristics, which further distinguish the sexes.\\n\\n\\nOn average, females begin puberty at ages 10–11 and complete puberty at ages 15–17; males generally begin puberty at ages 11–12 and complete puberty at ages 16–17.[1][2][3] The major landmark of puberty for females is menarche, the onset of menstruation, which occurs on average between ages 12 and 13.[2] For males, first ejaculation, spermarche, occurs on average at age 13.[4] In the 21st century, the average age at which children, especially females, reach specific markers of puberty is lower compared to the 19th century, when it was 15 for females and 17 for males (with age at first periods for females and voice-breaks for males being used as examples).[5] This can be due to any number of factors, including improved nutrition resulting in rapid body growth, increased weight and fat deposition,[6] or exposure to endocrine disruptors such as xenoestrogens, which can at times be due to food consumption or other environmental factors.[7][8] However, more modern archeological research suggests that the rate of puberty as it occurs now is the intended way. Growth spurts began at around 10–12, but markers of later stages of puberty such as menarche had delays that correlated with severe environmental conditions such as poverty, poor nutrition, air and pollution.[9][10][11] Puberty that starts earlier than usual is known as precocious puberty, and puberty which starts later than usual is known as delayed puberty.\\n\\n\\nNotable among the morphologic changes in size, shape, composition, and functioning of the pubertal body, is the development of secondary sex characteristics, the \"filling in\" of the child\\'s body; from girl to woman, from boy to man. Derived from the Latin puberatum (age of maturity), the word puberty describes the physical changes to sexual maturation, not the psychosocial and cultural maturation denoted by the term adolescent development in Western culture, wherein adolescence is the period of mental transition from childhood to adulthood, which overlaps much of the body\\'s period of puberty.[12]\\n\\n\\nTwo of the most significant differences between puberty in females and puberty in males are the age at which it begins, and the major sex steroids involved, the androgens and the estrogens.\\n\\n\\nAlthough there is a wide range of normal ages, females typically begin puberty around ages 10–11 and end puberty around 15–17; males begin around ages 11–12 and end around 16–17.[1][2][3] Females attain reproductive maturity about four years after the first physical changes of puberty appear.[13] In contrast, males accelerate more slowly but continue to grow for about six years after the first visible pubertal changes.[14] Any increase in height beyond the post-pubertal age is uncommon.\\n\\n\\nFor males, the androgen testosterone is the principal sex hormone; while testosterone is produced, all males\\' changes  are characterized as virilization. A substantial product of testosterone metabolism in males is the estrogen estradiol. The conversion of testosterone to estradiol depends on the amount of body fat and estradiol levels in males are typically much lower than in females. The male \"growth spurt\" also begins later, accelerates more slowly, and lasts longer before the epiphyses fuse. Although males are on average 2 centimetres (0.8\\xa0in) shorter than females before puberty begins, adult men are on average about 13 centimetres (5.1\\xa0in) taller than women. Most of this sex difference in adult heights is attributable to a later onset of the growth spurt and a slower progression to completion, a direct result of the later rise and lower adult male levels of estradiol.[15]\\n\\n\\nThe hormonal maturation of females is considerably more complicated than in males. The main steroid hormones, testosterone, estradiol, and progesterone as well as prolactin play important physiological functions in puberty. The production of gonadal steroids in females starts with production of testosterone, which is typically quickly converted to estradiol inside the ovaries. However the rate of conversion from testosterone to estradiol (driven by FSH/LH balance) during early puberty is highly individual, resulting in very diverse development patterns of secondary sexual characteristics. Production of progesterone in the ovaries begins with the development of ovulatory cycles in females (during the lutheal phase of the cycle), before puberty low levels of progesterone are produced in the adrenal glands of both males and females. Estradiol levels rise earlier and reach higher levels in women than in men. While estradiol promotes growth of the breasts and uterus, it is also the principal hormone driving the pubertal growth spurt and epiphyseal maturation and closure.[16]\\n\\n\\nPuberty is preceded by adrenarche, marking an increase of adrenal androgen production between ages 6–10. Adrenarche is  sometimes accompanied by the early appearance of axillary and pubic hair. The first androgenic hair resulting from adrenarche can be also transient and disappear before the onset of true puberty.\\n\\n\\nThe onset of puberty is associated with high GnRH pulsing, which precedes the rise in sex hormones, LH and FSH.[17] Exogenous GnRH pulses cause the onset of puberty.[18] Brain tumors which increase GnRH output may also lead to premature puberty.[19]\\n\\n\\nThe cause of the GnRH rise is unknown. Leptin might be the cause of the GnRH rise. Leptin has receptors in the hypothalamus which synthesizes GnRH.[20] Individuals who are deficient in leptin fail to initiate puberty.[21] The levels of leptin increase with the onset of puberty, and then decline to adult levels when puberty is completed. The rise in GnRH might also be caused by genetics. A study[22] discovered that a mutation in genes encoding both neurokinin B as well as the neurokinin B receptor can alter the timing of puberty. The researchers hypothesized that neurokinin B might play a role in regulating the secretion of kisspeptin, a compound responsible for triggering direct release of GnRH as well as indirect release of LH and FSH.\\n\\n\\nSeveral studies about puberty have examined the effects of an early or a late onset of puberty in males and females. In general, females who enter puberty late experience positive outcomes in adolescence and adulthood, while females who enter puberty early experience negative outcomes. Males who have earlier pubertal timing generally have more positive outcomes in adulthood but more negative outcomes in adolescence, while the reverse is true for later pubertal timing.[23]\\n\\n\\nOutcomes have generally indicated that early onset of puberty in females can be psychologically damaging. The main reason for this detrimental effect is the issue of body image. As they physically develop, gaining weight in several areas of the body, early-maturing females usually look larger than females who have not yet entered puberty. A result of the social pressure to be thin, the early-maturing females develop a negative view of their body image. In addition, people may tease the females about their visible breasts, forcing the early-maturing female to hide her breasts by dressing differently. Embarrassment about a more developed body may also result in the refusal to undress for gym. These experiences lead to lower self-esteem, more depression and poorer body image in these early-maturing females.[23]\\n\\n\\nFurthermore, as physical and emotional differences set them apart from people in their same age group, early-maturing females develop relationships with older people. For instance, some early-maturing females have older malefriends, \"attracted to the females\\' womanly physique and femaleish innocence.\"[23] While having an older malefriend might improve popularity among peers, it also increases the risk of alcohol and drug use, increased sexual relations (often unprotected), eating disorders and bullying.[23]\\n\\n\\nGenerally, later onset of puberty in females produces positive outcomes. They exhibit positive behaviors in adolescence that continue to adulthood.[23]\\n\\n\\nIn the past, early onset of puberty in males has been associated with positive outcomes, such as leadership in high school and success in adulthood.[24] However, recent studies have revealed that the risks and problems of early maturation in males might outweigh the benefits.[23]\\n\\n\\nEarly-maturing males develop \"more aggressive, law-breaking, and alcohol abusing\" behaviors, which result in anger towards parents and trouble in school and with the police. Early puberty also correlates with increased sexual activity and a higher instance of teenage pregnancy, both of which can lead to depression and other psychosocial issues.[23]  However, early puberty might also result in positive outcomes, such as popularity among peers, higher self-esteem and confidence, as a result of physical developments, such as taller height, developed muscles, muscular male breast and better athletic ability.\\n\\n\\nOn the other hand, late-maturing males develop lower self-esteem and confidence and generally have lower popularity among peers, due to their less-developed physiques. Also, they experience problems with anxiety and depression and are more likely to be afraid of sex than other males.[23]\\n\\n\\nIn males, puberty begins with the enlargement of the testicles and scrotum. The penis also increases in size, and a male develops pubic hair. A male\\'s testicles also begin making sperm. The release of semen, which contains sperm and other fluids, is called ejaculation.[25] During puberty, a male\\'s erect penis becomes capable of ejaculating semen and impregnating a female.[26][27] A male\\'s first ejaculation is an important milestone in his development.[28] On average, a male\\'s first ejaculation occurs at age 13.[4] Ejaculation sometimes occurs during sleep; this phenomenon is known as a nocturnal emission.[25]\\n\\n\\nIn males, testicular enlargement is the first physical manifestation of puberty (and is termed gonadarche).[29] Testes in prepubertal males change little in size from about 1 year of age to the onset of puberty, averaging about 2–3\\xa0cm in length and about 1.5–2\\xa0cm in width. The size of the testicles is among the parameters of the Tanner scale for male genitals, from stage I which represents a volume of less than 1.5 ml, to stage V which represents a testicular volume of greater than or equal to 20 ml. Testicular size reaches maximal adult size about 6 years after the onset of puberty.  While 18–20\\xa0cm3 is an average adult size, there is wide variation in testicular size in the normal population.[30] After the male\\'s testicles have enlarged and developed for about one year, the length and then the breadth of the shaft of the penis will increase and the glans penis and corpora cavernosa will also start to enlarge to adult proportions.[31]\\n\\n\\nBy the end of puberty, adult men have heavier bones and nearly twice as much skeletal muscle. Some of the bone growth (e.g. shoulder width and jaw) is disproportionately greater, resulting in noticeably different male and female skeletal shapes. The average adult male has about 150% of the lean body mass of an average female, and about 50% of the body fat.\\n\\n\\nThis muscle develops mainly during the later stages of puberty, and muscle growth can continue even after males are biologically adult. The peak of the so-called \"strength spurt\", the rate of muscle growth, is attained about one year after a male experiences his peak growth rate.\\n\\n\\nOften, the fat pads of the male breast tissue and the male nipples will develop during puberty; sometimes, especially in one breast, this becomes more apparent and is termed gynecomastia. It is usually not a permanent phenomenon.\\n\\n\\nErections during sleep or when waking up are medically known as nocturnal penile tumescence and colloquially referred to as morning wood.[32] The penis can regularly get erect during sleep and men or males often wake up with an erection.[33] Once a male reaches his teenage years, erections occur much more frequently due to puberty.[34] Erections can occur spontaneously at any time of day, and if clothed may cause a bulge or \"hump\". This can be disguised or hidden by wearing close-fitting underwear, a long shirt and baggier clothes.[35] Erections are common for male prepubescent children and infants, and can even occur before birth.[36] Spontaneous erections are also known as involuntary or unwanted erections and are normal. Such erections can be embarrassing if they happen in public, such as a classroom or living room.[37][38]\\n\\n\\nDuring puberty, if not before, the tip and opening of a male\\'s foreskin becomes wider, progressively allowing for retraction down the shaft of the penis and behind the glans, which ultimately should be possible without pain or difficulty. The membrane that bonds the inner surface of the foreskin with the glans disintegrates and releases the foreskin to separate from the glans. The foreskin then gradually becomes retractable.[39]\\n\\n\\nResearch by Øster (1968) found that with the onset and continuation of puberty, the proportion of males able to pull back their foreskins increased. At ages 12–13, Øster found that only 60% of males were able to retract their foreskins; this increased to 85% by ages 14–15, and 95% by 16–17. He also found that 1% of those unable to fully retract experienced phimosis at ages 14–17, the remainder were partially able to.[39] The findings were supported by further research by Kayaba et al (1996) on a sample of over 600 males,[40] and Ishikawa and Kawakita (2004) found that by age 15, 77% of their sample of males could retract their foreskins.[41]  Beaugé (1997) reports that males may assist the development of retractile foreskin by manual stretching.[42]\\n\\n\\nOnce a male is able to retract his foreskin, penile hygiene should become an important feature of his routine body care. Although the American Academy of Pediatrics states there is \"little evidence to affirm the association between circumcision status and optimal penile hygiene\",[43] various studies suggest that males be educated about the role of hygiene, including retracting the foreskin while urinating and rinsing under it and around the glans at each bathing opportunity. Regular washing under the foreskin was found by Krueger and Osborn (1986) to reduce the risk of numerous penile disorders,[44] however Birley et al. (1993) report excessive washing with soap should be avoided because it dries the oils out of the tissues and can cause non-specific dermatitis.[45]\\n\\n\\nPubic hair often appears on a male shortly after the genitalia begin to grow.  The pubic hairs are usually first visible at the dorsal (abdominal) base of the penis. The first few hairs are described as stage 2. Stage 3 is usually reached within another 6–12 months, when the hairs are too many to count. By stage 4, the pubic hairs densely fill the \"pubic triangle\". Stage 5 refers to the spread of pubic hair to the thighs and upward towards the navel as part of the developing abdominal hair.\\n\\n\\nIn the months and years following the appearance of pubic hair, other areas of skin that respond to androgens may develop androgenic hair. The usual sequence is: underarm (axillary) hair, perianal hair, upper lip hair, sideburn (preauricular) hair, periareolar hair, and the beard area.[46] As with most human biological processes, this specific order may vary among some individuals. Arm, leg, chest, abdominal, and back hair become heavier more gradually. There is a large range in amount of body hair among adult men, and significant differences in timing and quantity of hair growth among different racial groups. Facial hair is often present in late adolescence, but may not appear until significantly later.[47][48] Facial hair will continue to get coarser, darker and thicker for another 2–4 years after puberty.[47] Some men do not develop full facial hair for up to 10 years after the completion of puberty.[47] Chest hair may appear during puberty or years after, though not all men develop it.\\n\\n\\nUnder the influence of androgens, the larynx (or voice box) grows in both sexes. This growth is far more prominent in males, causing the male voice to drop and deepen, sometimes abruptly but rarely \"overnight\", about one octave, because the longer and thicker vocal folds have a lower fundamental frequency. Before puberty, the larynx of males and females is about equally small.[49] Occasionally, voice change is accompanied by unsteadiness of vocalization in the early stages of untrained voices. Most of the voice change happens during stage 3–4 of male puberty around the time of peak growth. Adult pitch is attained at an average age of 15 years, although the voice may not fully settle until early twenties. It usually precedes the development of significant facial hair by several months to years.\\n\\n\\nThe first physical sign of puberty in females is usually a firm, tender lump under the center of the areola of one or both breasts, occurring on average at about 10.5 years of age.[50] This is referred to as thelarche. By the widely used Tanner staging of puberty, this is stage 2 of breast development (stage 1 is a flat, prepubertal breast). Within 6–12 months, the swelling has clearly begun in both sides, softened, and can be felt and seen extending beyond the edges of the areolae. This is stage 3 of breast development. By another 12 months (stage 4), the breasts are approaching mature size and shape, with areolae and nipples forming a secondary mound. In most young women, this mound disappears into the contour of the mature breast (stage 5), although there is so much variation in sizes and shapes of adult breasts that stages 4 and 5 are not always separately identifiable.[51]\\n\\n\\nPubic hair is often the second noticeable change in puberty, usually within a few months of thelarche.[52] It is referred to as pubarche. The pubic hairs are usually visible first along the labia. The first few hairs are described as Tanner stage 2.[51] Stage 3 is usually reached within another 6–12 months, when the hairs are too numerous to count and appear on the pubic mound as well. By stage 4, the pubic hairs densely fill the \"pubic triangle\". Stage 5 refers to spread of pubic hair to the thighs and sometimes as abdominal hair upward towards the navel. In about 15% of females, the earliest pubic hair appears before breast development begins.[52]\\n\\n\\nPerineal skin keratinizes due to effect of estrogen increasing its resistance to infection. The mucosal surface of the vagina also changes in response to increasing levels of estrogen, becoming thicker and duller pink in color (in contrast to the brighter red of the prepubertal vaginal mucosa).[53] Mucosa changes into a multilayered structure with superficial layer of squamous cells. Estrogen increase glycogen content in vaginal epithelium, which in future plays important part in maintaining vaginal pH. Whitish secretions (physiologic leukorrhea) are a normal effect of estrogen as well.[50] In the two years following thelarche, the uterus, ovaries, and the follicles in the ovaries increase in size.[54] The ovaries usually contain small follicular cysts visible by ultrasound.[55][56] Before puberty, uterine body to cervix ratio is 1:1; which increases to 2:1 or 3:1 after completion of pubertal period.\\n\\n\\nThe first menstrual bleeding is referred to as menarche, and typically occurs about two years after thelarche.[52] The average age of menarche is 12.5 in the United States.[57] Most American females experience their first period at 11, 12 or 13, but some experience it earlier than their 11th birthday and others after their 14th birthday. In fact, anytime between 8 and 16 is normal. In Canada, the average age of menarche is 12.72,[58] and in the United Kingdom it is 12.9.[59] The time between menstrual periods (menses) is not always regular in the first two years after menarche.[60] Ovulation is necessary for fertility, but may or may not accompany the earliest menses.[61] In postmenarchal females, about 80% of the cycles were anovulatory in the first year after menarche, 50% in the third year and 10% in the sixth year.[60] Initiation of ovulation after menarche is not inevitable. A high proportion of females with continued irregularity in the menstrual cycle several years from menarche will continue to have prolonged irregularity and anovulation, and are at higher risk for reduced fertility.[62]\\n\\n\\nDuring this period, also in response to rising levels of estrogen, the lower half of the pelvis and thus hips widen (providing a larger birth canal).[51][63] Fat tissue increases to a greater percentage of the body composition than in males, especially in the typical female distribution of breasts, hips, buttocks, thighs, upper arms, and pubis. Progressive differences in fat distribution as well as sex differences in local skeletal growth contribute to the typical female body shape by the end of puberty. On average, at 10 years, females have 6% more body fat than males.[64]\\n\\n\\nRising levels of androgens can change the fatty acid composition of perspiration, resulting in a more \"adult\" body odor. This often precedes thelarche and pubarche by one or more years. Another androgen effect is increased secretion of oil (sebum) from the skin. This change increases the susceptibility to acne, a skin condition that is characteristic of puberty. Acne varies greatly in its severity.[65]\\n\\n\\nIn females, estradiol (the primary female sex hormone) causes thickening of lips and oral mucosa as well as further development of the vulva. In the vulva and vagina, estradiol causes thickening (stratification) of the skin and the growth of both the myoepithelial layer and the smooth muscle of the vagina. Typically estradiol will also cause pronounced growth of the labia minora and to a lesser degree of the labia majora.\\n\\n\\nEstradiol is also responsible for the increased production of pheomelanin, resulting in the characteristic red color of the lips, labia minora and sometimes labia majora. Estradiol together with other ovarian steroids also cause the darker coloration of the areola.\\n\\n\\nTestosterone will cause an enlargement of the clitoris and possibly has important effects on the growth and maturation of the vestibular bulbs, corpus cavernosum of the clitoris and urethral sponge.[66]\\n\\n\\nChanges of the vulva initiated by estradiol as well as its direct effects also appear to influence the functioning of the lower urinary tract.[67][68]\\n\\n\\nHair growth develops under the arms, starting out sparse before thickening and darkening over time.[69]\\n\\n\\nIn a general sense, the conclusion of puberty is reproductive maturity. Criteria for defining the conclusion may differ for different purposes: attainment of the ability to reproduce, achievement of maximal adult height, maximal gonadal size, or adult sex hormone levels. Maximal adult height is achieved at an average age of 15 years for an average female and 18 years for an average male. Potential fertility (sometimes termed nubility) usually precedes completion of growth by 1–2 years in females and 3–4 years in males. Stage 5 typically represents maximal gonadal growth and adult hormone levels.\\n\\n\\nThe definition of the onset of puberty may depend on perspective (e.g., hormonal versus physical) and purpose (establishing population normal standards, clinical care of early or late pubescent individuals, etc.). A common definition for the onset of puberty is physical changes to a person\\'s body.[13] These physical changes are the first visible signs of neural, hormonal, and gonadal function changes.\\n\\n\\nThe age at which puberty begins varies between individuals; usually, puberty begins between 10 and 13 years of age. The age at which puberty begins is affected by both genetic factors and by environmental factors such as nutritional state and social circumstances.[70] An example of social circumstances is the Vandenbergh effect; a juvenile female who has significant interaction with adult males will enter puberty earlier than juvenile females who are not socially overexposed to adult males.[71]\\n\\n\\nThe average age at which puberty begins may be affected by ethnicity as well. For example, the average age of menarche in various populations surveyed has ranged from 12[57][58][59] to 18 years. The earliest average onset of puberty is for African-American females and the latest average onset for high altitude subsistence populations in Asia. However, much of the higher age averages reflect nutritional limitations more than genetic differences and can change within a few generations with a substantial change in diet. The median age of menarche for a population may be an index of the proportion of undernourished females in the population, and the width of the spread may reflect unevenness of wealth and food distribution in a population.\\n\\n\\nResearchers have identified an earlier age of the onset of puberty.  However, they have based their conclusions on a comparison of data from 1999 with data from 1969.  In the earlier example, the sample population was based on a small sample of white females (200, from Britain).  The later study identified as puberty as occurring in 48% of African-American females by age nine, and 12% of white females by that age.[72]\\n\\n\\nOne possible cause of a delay in the onset of puberty past the age 14 in females and 15 in males is Kallmann syndrome, a form of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH). Kallmann syndrome is also associated with a lack of sense of smell (anosmia). Kallmann syndrome and other forms of HH affect both men and women. It is caused by a failure in HPG axis at puberty which results in low or zero gonadotropin (LH and FSH) levels with the subsequent result of a failure to commence or complete puberty, secondary hypogonadism and infertility.[73][74]\\n\\n\\nThe average age at which the onset of puberty occurs has dropped significantly since the 1840s.[75][76][77] In every decade from 1840 to 1950 there was a drop of four months in the average age of menarche among Western European females. In Norway, females born in 1840 had their menarche at an average age of 17 years. In France, the average in 1840 was 15.3 years. In England, the average in 1840 was 16.5 years. In Japan, the decline happened later and was then more rapid: from 1945 to 1975 in Japan there was a drop of 11 months per decade.\\n\\n\\nA 2006 study in Denmark found that puberty, as evidenced by breast development, started at an average age of 9 years and 10 months, a year earlier than when a similar study was done in 1991. Scientists believe the phenomenon could be linked to obesity or exposure to chemicals in the food chain, and is putting females at greater long-term risk of breast cancer.[78]\\n\\n\\nVarious studies have found direct genetic effects to account for at least 46% of the variation of timing of puberty in well-nourished populations.[79][80][81][82] The genetic association of timing is strongest between mothers and daughters. The specific genes affecting timing are not yet known.[79] Among the candidates is an androgen receptor gene.[83]\\n\\n\\nResearchers have hypothesized that early puberty onset may be caused by certain hair care products containing estrogen or placenta, and by certain chemicals, namely phthalates, which are used in many cosmetics, toys, and plastic food containers.[72]\\n\\n\\nIf genetic factors account for half of the variation of pubertal timing, environment factors are clearly important as well. One of the first observed environmental effects is that puberty occurs later in children raised at higher altitudes. The most important of the environmental influences is clearly nutrition, but a number of others have been identified, all which affect timing of female puberty and menarche more clearly than male puberty.\\n\\n\\nThere is theoretical concern, and animal evidence, that environmental hormones and chemicals may affect aspects of prenatal or postnatal sexual development in humans.[84] Large amounts of incompletely metabolized estrogens and progestogens from pharmaceutical products are excreted into the sewage systems of large cities, and are sometimes detectable in the environment. Sex steroids are sometimes used in cattle farming but have been banned in chicken meat production for 40 years. Although agricultural laws regulate use to minimize accidental human consumption, the rules are largely self-enforced in the United States. Significant exposure of a child to hormones or other substances that activate estrogen or androgen receptors could produce some or all of the changes of puberty.\\n\\n\\nHarder to detect as an influence on puberty are the more diffusely distributed environmental chemicals like PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyl), which can bind and trigger estrogen receptors.\\n\\n\\nMore obvious degrees of partial puberty from direct exposure of young children to small but significant amounts of pharmaceutical sex steroids from exposure at home may be detected during medical evaluation for precocious puberty, but mild effects and the other potential exposures outlined above would not.\\n\\n\\nBisphenol A (BPA) is a chemical used to make plastics, and is frequently used to make baby bottles, water bottles, sports equipment, medical devices, and as a coating in food and beverage cans.  Scientists are concerned about BPA\\'s behavioral effects on fetuses, infants, and children at current exposure levels because it can affect the prostate gland, mammary gland, and lead to early puberty in females. BPA mimics and interferes with the action of estrogen—an important reproduction and development regulator. It leaches out of plastic into liquids and foods, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found measurable amounts of BPA in the bodies of more than 90 percent of the U.S. population studied.  The highest estimated daily intakes of BPA occur in infants and children. Many plastic baby bottles contain BPA, and BPA is more likely to leach out of plastic when its temperature is increased, as when one warms a baby bottle or warms up food in the microwave.[85]\\n\\n\\nNutritional factors are the strongest and most obvious environmental factors affecting timing of puberty.[79] females are especially sensitive to nutritional regulation because they must contribute all of the nutritional support to a growing fetus. Surplus calories (beyond growth and activity requirements) are reflected in the amount of body fat, which signals to the brain the availability of resources for initiation of puberty and fertility.\\n\\n\\nMuch evidence suggests that for most of the last few centuries, nutritional differences accounted for majority of variation of pubertal timing in different populations, and even among social classes in the same population. Recent worldwide increased consumption of animal protein, other changes in nutrition, and increases in childhood obesity have resulted in falling ages of puberty, mainly in those populations with the higher previous ages. In many populations the amount of variation attributable to nutrition is shrinking.\\n\\n\\nAlthough available dietary energy (simple calories) is the most important dietary influence on timing of puberty, quality of the diet plays a role as well. Lower protein intakes and higher dietary fiber intakes, as occur with typical vegetarian diets, are associated with later onset and slower progression of female puberty.\\n\\n\\nScientific researchers have linked early obesity with an earlier onset of puberty in females.  They have cited obesity as a cause of breast development before nine years and menarche before twelve years.[86] Early puberty in females can be a harbinger of later health problems.[87]\\n\\n\\nThe average level of daily physical activity has also been shown to affect timing of puberty, especially in females. A high level of exercise, whether for athletic or body image purposes, or for daily subsistence, reduces energy calories available for reproduction and slows puberty. The exercise effect is often amplified by a lower body fat mass and cholesterol.\\n\\n\\nChronic diseases can delay puberty in both males and females. Those that involve chronic inflammation or interfere with nutrition have the strongest effect. In the western world, inflammatory bowel disease and tuberculosis have been notorious for such an effect in the last century, while in areas of the underdeveloped world, chronic parasite infections are widespread.\\n\\n\\nMental illnesses occur in puberty. The brain undergoes significant development by hormones which can contribute to mood disorders such as major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, dysthymia and schizophrenia. Females aged between 15 and 19 make up 40% of anorexia nervosa cases.[88]\\n\\n\\nSome of the least understood environmental influences on timing of puberty are social and psychological. In comparison with the effects of genetics, nutrition, and general health, social influences are small, shifting timing by a few months rather than years. Mechanisms of these social effects are unknown, though a variety of physiological processes, including pheromones, have been suggested based on animal research.\\n\\n\\nThe most important part of a child\\'s psychosocial environment is the family, and most of the social influence research has investigated features of family structure and function in relation to earlier or later female puberty. Most of the studies have reported that menarche may occur a few months earlier in females in high-stress households, whose fathers are absent during their early childhood, who have a stepfather in the home, who are subjected to prolonged sexual abuse in childhood, or who are adopted from a developing country at a young age. Conversely, menarche may be slightly later when a female grows up in a large family with a biological father present.\\n\\n\\nMore extreme degrees of environmental stress, such as wartime refugee status with threat to physical survival, have been found to be associated with delay of maturation, an effect that may be compounded by dietary inadequacy.\\n\\n\\nMost of these reported social effects are small and our understanding is incomplete. Most of these \"effects\" are statistical associations revealed by epidemiologic surveys. Statistical associations are not necessarily causal, and a variety of covariables and alternative explanations can be imagined. Effects of such small size can never be confirmed or refuted for any individual child. Furthermore, interpretations of the data are politically controversial because of the ease with which this type of research can be used for political advocacy. Accusations of bias based on political agenda sometimes accompany scientific criticism.\\n\\n\\nAnother limitation of the social research is that nearly all of it has concerned females, partly because female puberty requires greater physiologic resources and partly because it involves a unique event (menarche) that makes survey research into female puberty much simpler than male. More detail is provided in the menarche article.\\n\\n\\nThe sequence of events of pubertal development can occasionally vary. For example, in about 15% of males and females, pubarche (the first pubic hairs) can precede, respectively, gonadarche and thelarche by a few months. Rarely, menarche can occur before other signs of puberty in a few females. These variations deserve medical evaluation because they can occasionally signal a disease.\\n\\n\\nThe endocrine reproductive system consists of the hypothalamus, the pituitary, the gonads, and the adrenal glands, with input and regulation from many other body systems. True puberty is often termed \"central puberty\" because it begins as a process of the central nervous system. A simple description of hormonal puberty is as follows:\\n\\n\\nThe onset of this neurohormonal process may precede the first visible body changes by 1–2 years.\\n\\n\\nThe arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus is the driver of the reproductive system. It has neurons which generate and release pulses of GnRH into the portal venous system of the pituitary gland. The arcuate nucleus is affected and controlled by neuronal input from other areas of the brain and hormonal input from the gonads, adipose tissue and a variety of other systems.\\n\\n\\nThe pituitary gland responds to the pulsed GnRH signals by releasing LH and FSH into the blood of the general circulation, also in a pulsatile pattern.\\n\\n\\nThe gonads (testes and ovaries) respond to rising levels of LH and FSH by producing the steroid sex hormones, testosterone and estrogen.\\n\\n\\nThe adrenal glands are a second source for steroid hormones. Adrenal maturation, termed adrenarche, typically precedes gonadarche in mid-childhood.\\n\\n\\nThe endocrine reproductive system becomes functional by the end of the first trimester of fetal life. The testes and ovaries become briefly inactive around the time of birth but resume hormonal activity until several months after birth, when incompletely understood mechanisms in the brain begin to suppress the activity of the arcuate nucleus. This has been referred to as maturation of the prepubertal \"gonadostat\", which becomes sensitive to negative feedback by sex steroids. The period of hormonal activity until several months after birth, followed by suppression of activity, may correspond to the period of infant sexuality, followed by a latency stage, which Sigmund Freud described.[90]\\n\\n\\nGonadotropin and sex steroid levels fall to low levels (nearly undetectable by current clinical assays) for approximately another 8 to 10 years of childhood. Evidence is accumulating that the reproductive system is not totally inactive during the childhood years. Subtle increases in gonadotropin pulses occur, and ovarian follicles surrounding germ cells (future eggs) double in number.\\n\\n\\nNormal puberty is initiated in the hypothalamus, with de-inhibition of the pulse generator in the arcuate nucleus. This inhibition of the arcuate nucleus is an ongoing active suppression by other areas of the brain. The signal and mechanism releasing the arcuate nucleus from inhibition have been the subject of investigation for decades and remain incompletely understood. Leptin levels rise throughout childhood and play a part in allowing the arcuate nucleus to resume operation. If the childhood inhibition of the arcuate nucleus is interrupted prematurely by injury to the brain, it may resume pulsatile gonadotropin release and puberty will begin at an early age.\\n\\n\\nNeurons of the arcuate nucleus secrete gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) into the blood of the pituitary portal system. An American physiologist, Ernst Knobil, found that the GnRH signals from the hypothalamus induce pulsed secretion of LH (and to a lesser degree, FSH) at roughly 1–2 hour intervals. The LH pulses are the consequence of pulsatile GnRH secretion by the arcuate nucleus that, in turn, is the result of an oscillator or signal generator in the central nervous system (\"GnRH pulse generator\").[91] In the years preceding physical puberty, Robert M. Boyar discovered that the gonadotropin pulses occur only during sleep, but as puberty progresses they can be detected during the day.[92] By the end of puberty, there is little day-night difference in the amplitude and frequency of gonadotropin pulses.\\n\\n\\nSome investigators have attributed the onset of puberty to a resonance of oscillators in the brain.[93][94][95] By this mechanism, the gonadotropin pulses that occur primarily at night just before puberty represent beats.[96][97][98][99]\\n\\n\\nAn array of \"autoamplification processes\" increases the production of all of the pubertal hormones of the hypothalamus, pituitary, and gonads.[100]\\n\\n\\nRegulation of adrenarche and its relationship to maturation of the hypothalamic-gonadal axis is not fully understood, and some evidence suggests it is a parallel but largely independent process coincident with or even preceding central puberty. Rising levels of adrenal androgens (termed adrenarche) can usually be detected between 6 and 11 years of age, even before the increasing gonadotropin pulses of hypothalamic puberty. Adrenal androgens contribute to the development of pubic hair (pubarche), adult body odor, and other androgenic changes in both sexes. The primary clinical significance of the distinction between adrenarche and gonadarche is that pubic hair and body odor changes by themselves do not prove that central puberty is underway for an individual child.\\n\\n\\nEarly stages of male hypothalamic maturation seem to be very similar to the early stages of female puberty, though occurring about 1–2 years later.\\n\\n\\nLH stimulates the Leydig cells of the testes to make testosterone and blood levels begin to rise. For much of puberty, nighttime levels of testosterone are higher than daytime. Regularity of frequency and amplitude of gonadotropin pulses seems to be less necessary for progression of male than female puberty.\\n\\n\\nHowever, a significant portion of testosterone in adolescent males is converted to estradiol. Estradiol mediates the growth spurt, bone maturation, and epiphyseal closure in males just as in females. Estradiol also induces at least modest development of breast tissue (gynecomastia) in a large proportion of males. males who develop mild gynecomastia, a swellings under nipples, during puberty are told the effects are temporary in some male teenagers due to high levels of estradiol.\\n\\n\\nAnother hormonal change in males takes place during the teenage years for most young men. At this point in a male\\'s life the testosterone levels slowly rise, and most of the effects are mediated through the androgen receptors by way of conversion dihydrotestosterone in target organs (especially that of the bowels).\\n\\n\\nAs the amplitude of LH pulses increases, the theca cells of the ovaries begin to produce testosterone and smaller amounts of progesterone. Much of the testosterone moves into nearby cells called granulosa cells. Smaller increases of FSH induce an increase in the aromatase activity of these granulosa cells, which converts most of the testosterone to estradiol for secretion into the circulation. The remaining testosterone, together with adrenal androgens is responsible for the typical androgenic changes of female puberty: pubic hair, other androgenic hair as outlined above, body odor, acne. The bioactivity of testosterone is to a large degree limited by SHBG which in turn is mainly controlled by estradiol and prolactin levels (estradiol stimulates, prolactin decreases SHBG synthesis).\\n\\n\\nRising levels of estradiol produce the characteristic estrogenic body changes of female puberty: growth spurt, acceleration of bone maturation and closure, breast growth, increased fat composition, growth of the uterus, increased thickness of the endometrium and the vaginal mucosa, and widening of the lower pelvis.\\n\\n\\nAs the estradiol levels gradually rise and the other autoamplification processes occur, a point of maturation is reached when the feedback sensitivity of the hypothalamic \"gonadostat\" becomes positive. This attainment of positive feedback is the hallmark of female sexual maturity, as it allows the mid cycle LH surge necessary for ovulation.\\n\\n\\nGrowth hormone levels rise steadily throughout puberty. IGF1 levels rise and then decline as puberty ends. Growth finishes and adult height is attained as the estradiol levels complete closure of the epiphyses.\\n'], 'label': [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n"
